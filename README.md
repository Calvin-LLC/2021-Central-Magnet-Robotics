# Central-Magnet-Robotics

-- Home work due by the end of fall break -- 
1. Set up both android studio & github
2. Learn how to store different data types, and basic arithmatics (addition / subtraction of variables etc)
3. Learn our standard naming conventions (how you name variables and functions)
4. Learn how to commit to the GitHub repository

// if you need help, dont be afraid to contact me through teams. I am more than willing to sit in a 1 on 1 meeting and screenshare and explain how to do these different tasks, if you guys are all willing, ill do a single meeting where I go over everything and upload a video of it afterwards. Ill post the naming conventions later this week before fall break.

-- Ways To Learn -- 
1. https://leetcode.com
     Director of hire at google told me that a lot of employees used this website to freshen up their skills. It gives problems in the form of challenges that you need to solve in your language of choice. (14 Languages supported, including Java & C++)
     
2. https://www.w3schools.com/java/
     What I've personally used to fill in any blanks in my knowledge. Gives great explanations and can quiz you on what you just learned to make sure you understand.
     
3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRubcjpTkks
     This guy goes over data types and basics of programming that we expect you to know by the end of fall break.
