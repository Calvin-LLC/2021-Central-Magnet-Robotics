# Central-Magnet-Robotics

// if you need help, dont be afraid to contact me through teams. I am more than willing to sit in a 1 on 1 meeting and screenshare and explain how to do different tasks.


-- Ways To Learn -- 
* https://leetcode.com
     -Director of hire at google told me that a lot of employees used this website to freshen up their skills. It gives problems in the form of challenges that you need to solve in your language of choice. (14 Languages supported, including Java & C++)
     
* https://www.w3schools.com/java/
     -What I've personally used to fill in any blanks in my knowledge. Gives great explanations and can quiz you on what you just learned to make sure you understand.

     -This guy goes over data types and basics of programming that we expect you to know by the end of fall break.


-- FTC Specific learning utilities -- 
* season info: https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc/game-and-season
* ftc documentation: https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/index.html
* simple setup guide (android studio with ftc): https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-guide.pdf*/


-- To Do --
* Organizing last year's code (comment it all) // not really needed, the examples FTC gives us show mostly everything
* Make sure movement is still working on both robots
* Make sure all functions of each robot are working
* Change speeds / controls for each team so that the person controlling competition day is ballin'
* Learn how to set up the camera with the robot
* Set up tensorflow
* Use tensorflow to make an autonomous


-- ChangeLog --
* Date: brief synopsis of what we did (part of the 20 minute time period)
* 9/28/2021  - Cover basics of Java (data types, classes & objects), all meeting to this point
* 10/21/2021 - Simple movement code being done by all
* 12/9/2021 - movement code should be done, and proper error handling added
